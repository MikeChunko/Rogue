# Rogue
This is a simple roguelike game designed as a way of getting comfortable with programming basic games and using python-tcod library.

# Running It
Currently the only way to run the game is to clone the repository, install [python-libtcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod),
and execute ```engine.py```.
An executable file may be added later when the game is in a more finished state and has more "game" to it.

# Licensing
python-libtcod is distributed under the [Simplified 2-clause FreeBSD license](https://github.com/MikeChunko/Rogue/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
